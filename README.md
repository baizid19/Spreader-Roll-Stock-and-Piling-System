# Spreader-Roll-Stock-and-Piling-System
Developed an Excel-based system to efficiently manage and monitor the stock and piling of spreader rolls in a jute mill. The project focused on ensuring optimal utilization and tracking of raw materials and semi-finished products throughout the production process.

Key Features and Contributions:

Data Management: Automated tracking of pile numbers, grades, roll stocks, and statuses (e.g., Open, Running, Close) for seamless inventory management.

Process Optimization: Enabled real-time calculation of matured time for piles, visually represented using conditional formatting (e.g., green for matured, red for not matured, and yellow for over-matured).

Ease of Use: Designed dropdown menus for grade selection and automated fields for opening and closing times to minimize manual input errors.

Reporting and Insights: Created dynamic dashboards and reports summarizing stock status, production progress, and pile readiness for consumption.

Operational Impact: Improved tracking accuracy, reduced delays in the production line, and enhanced material utilization by providing actionable data for decision-making.
